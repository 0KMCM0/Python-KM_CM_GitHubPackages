First, You will Need to Install The One and Only Requirement - The `requests` Module. Then, Download ZIP from [The Main Page](https://github.com/0KMCM0/Python-KM_CM_GitHubPackages), Extract It, Copy ``KM_CM_GitHubPackages`` (Not The One Where ``README.md`` is), Go to Where Your Python Stores Site Packages (Usually ``C:/Users/[You]/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python[Version]/Lib/site-packages``), and Paste It There.
