Each Package has The Following Fields That can be Used to Identify It: Name, Owner, and Account.
Only Owner and Account Require Explanations - ``Owner`` is The Prefix - How The Owner of The Package
Prefers to Mark Themselves (Usually Initials or a Short Name). ``Account`` is The Name of
The Owner's GitHub Account, and can be Different from ``Owner``.

A Package is a Repository That is Named in Format ``Python-[Owner]_[Name]``,
and Owned by ``Account``. It has a Folder Named in Format ``[Ownder]_[Name]`` -
The GHP will Use That Folder Instead of The Whole Repository.
